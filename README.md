# AI in Electromagnetic Optimization

We would like to maintain an up-to-date list of progress (papers, codes etc) made in applying AI to electromagnetic optimization, and provide a guide for some of the papers that have received wide interest.
Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/KevJames2019/AI-in-Electromagnetic-Optimization/issues) to add papers.
